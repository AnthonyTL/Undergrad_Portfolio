# Introduction

These are the four most significant coding projects from my undergraduate classes at the University of California Santa Cruz. 

## Hydrogen Radio Background
### ASTR 135 Advanced Astrophysics Lab
### Abstract:
Radio observations of the 21cm emission line from neutral hydrogen (HI) are indispensable tools in studying the structure and rotation of the Milky Way galaxy. Measuring the intensity of the 21cm line along a given line of sight makes it possible to determine the amount of HI in that direction, and observing the lineâ€™s Doppler shift allows for the understanding of the radial motion of that quantity of HI. As such, the measurement and analysis of the 21cm line along different galactic coordinates provide a measure of the quantity of HI as well as the radial motion of HI along those coordinates. In this experiment, we measure the 21cm line with a 1.8m radio dish along several galactic coordinates in the Milky Way galaxy's Quadrants Ib and III. Using our measurements of the 21cm line, we calculate the column density of HI (a measure of the quantity of HI) along each coordinate's line of sight and note the Doppler shifts of the 21cm line for each observation

## Molecular Dynamics
### PHYS 115 Computational Physics
### Abstract
When analyzing systems that include many particles, the usual way to determine meaningful quantities is to use statistical mechanics to find average values of quantities such as energy and temperature. Typically, intermolecular forces are ignored and each particle is assumed to be a hard point mass. When intermolecular forces are considered, the problem is reduced to only two or three particles for simple calculations. With molecular dynamic simulations, however, it is possible to have a large number of particles while still accounting for intermolecular forces. In this project, I used the Lennard-Jones potential model with the Velocity-Verlet algorithm to create such a simulation. The simulation produced the expected results at low and high temperatures, but there are still unresolved issues for the interaction of elements that should be solid at room temperature.  


## Solar Spectrum
### ASTR 135 Advanced Astrophysics Lab
### Abstract:
This study seeks to determine the chemical composition of the Sun. We observed the Sun on the morning of Friday, May 5th, 2023, and used a spectrometer to collect both high and low-resolution first-order spectral lines of the Sun. With these, we determined the wavelengths of the absorption lines and compared these to the absorption lines of expected elements in the Sun to identify its composition. We found the number of elements in the Sun which are laid out in 5.1 table 4 and match many of the elements we expected to see.

## Star Clusters
### ASTR 135 Advanced Astrophysics Lab
### Abstract:
In this study, we observed the stellar clusters Messier 3(M3) and Messier 67(M67) on April 13th, 2023 with the Nickel Telescope at the Lick Observatory. Our analysis utilizes source extractor to obtain stars' fluxes which we convert to magnitudes to ultimately create Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams. We then fit these with theoretical isochrones to determine the ages and metallicities of the clusters. We found M3 to be between 11.22 Gyr and 15.85 Gyr and Z = 0.001 and M67 to be between 3.55 Gyr and 4.49 Gyr and Z = 0.019. These results agree well with other values found in current literature.
